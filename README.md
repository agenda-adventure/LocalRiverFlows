20250502 - v 1.2.0

Changes
-Added search feature at the state level since some river-y states have a LOT more gauges than I realized.
-Changed the 7 day trend graphing to increase granularity at the expense of a smooth (but sort of informationally-dumb) graph.
Fixes
-Cleaned out an old debugging message that would crop up when the user tried to access gauge data while out of WiFi or cellular service

20250504 - v 1.2.1

Changes
-None
Fixes
-Corrected an issue where the flow information stopped updating in the foreground.

20250521 - v 1.3

Changes
-Added the ability to delete individual gauge listings on the 'Recently Viewed' drop down menu.
Fixes

20260222 - v 1.6.1
Changes
-None

Fixes
-Thanks to a user for pointing out a bug where removing the default gauge would not be permanent across restarts of the app. 

Future

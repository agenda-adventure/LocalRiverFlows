20250502 - v 1.2.0

Changes
-Added search feature at the state level since some river-y states have a LOT more gauges than I realized.
-Changed the 7 day trend graphing to increase granularity at the expense of a smooth (but sort of informationally-dumb) graph.
Fixes
-Cleaned out an old debugging message that would crop up when the user tried to access gauge data while out of WiFi or cellular service
